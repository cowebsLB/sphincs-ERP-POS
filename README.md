# Sphincs ERP + POS

Integrated Enterprise Resource Planning and Point of Sale system for Windows.

## Overview

Sphincs ERP + POS is a comprehensive business management system consisting of two separate Windows applications:

- **Sphincs ERP**: Enterprise Resource Planning for inventory, staff, reporting, and management
- **Sphincs POS**: Point of Sale for fast transaction processing, kitchen integration, and sales

Both applications share the same local SQLite database and sync with a cloud database.

### Fully Integrated Architecture

- **Single Source of Truth**: Every ERP, POS, mobile, and analytics component reads/writes through the same SQLAlchemy models, so data stays consistent automatically.
- **Advanced Operations Hub**: A dedicated module inside the ERP consolidates Reservations, Vendor Contracts, Training, Audits, Maintenance, Delivery, Menu Engineering, Events, and Safety workflows with matching UI styling and shared permissions.
- **Shared Services**: Authentication, roles/permissions, logging, audit trails, PDF generation, predictive analytics, and integrations are reused across modules (desktop + mobile + API).

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Windows 10/11
- SQLite 3 (included with Python)
- Internet connection (for cloud sync and updates)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sphincs-erp-pos
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initialize Database

The database will be automatically created on first run. Default roles (28 roles) are automatically created on first launch. However, you need to create an admin user:

```bash
# Create admin staff user (username: admin, password: admin)
python src/utils/create_admin_staff.py
```

**Note**: The system automatically creates 28 predefined roles on first run, organized into:
- System & ERP Admin (3 roles)
- Corporate Management (6 roles)
- Branch-Level Management (4 roles)
- Operational / Staff (8 roles)
- Specialized / Optional (4 roles)

### 4. Launch Applications

**Sphincs ERP:**
```bash
python src/erp_main.py
```

**Sphincs POS:**
```bash
python src/pos_main.py
```

## Automated Testing

An end-to-end regression script, `test_all_features.py`, exercises every major subsystem (database, models, CRUD, utilities, dialogs, GUI imports, APIs, integrations, configuration, notification flows, and performance checks).

```bash
python test_all_features.py
```

- Produces real-time console output plus a timestamped report file (e.g. `test_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`) summarizing pass/fail counts per category.
- Covers 380+ assertions, ensuring recent changes haven’t broken ERP, POS, or API modules.
- Optional dependencies: install `pyotp` and `qrcode[pil]` if you want Two-Factor Authentication tests to run as well.

## Building Executables

The project ships PyInstaller specs (`erp.spec`, `pos.spec`) and a helper script (`build_exe.py`) so you can generate Windows executables for both ERP and POS.

1. Install PyInstaller (once per environment):
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. Run the automated build script from the project root:
   ```bash
   python build_exe.py
   ```

The script runs both spec files, bundles icons plus configuration assets, and drops `SphincsERP.exe` and `SphincsPOS.exe` into `dist/`. See `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for advanced packaging notes (custom icons, hidden imports, signing, etc.).

## First Run Setup

1. **Database Initialization**
   - The application automatically creates the SQLite database at `%APPDATA%\Sphincs ERP+POS\sphincs.db`
   - Run the role and admin creation scripts (see Installation step 3)

2. **Login**
   - Default admin credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin`
   - **Important**: Change the default password after first login

3. **Configuration**
   - Configuration files are stored in `%APPDATA%\Sphincs ERP+POS\`
   - Edit `config.ini` to customize settings:
     - Database settings
     - Update settings (GitHub repository)
     - UI preferences
     - Hardware settings

## Usage

### ERP Dashboard

1. **Login**: Enter your username and password
2. **Navigation**: Use the sidebar to navigate between modules
3. **Sidebar Toggle**: Click the ☰ button to collapse/expand the sidebar
4. **Module Features**:
   - Each module supports Add, Edit, Delete operations
   - Search and filter functionality available
   - Data is automatically saved to the database

### Key Features

- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Click the hamburger menu (☰) to toggle between collapsed (icons only) and expanded (icons + text) views
- **Grouped Navigation**: Related modules are grouped into collapsible sections (e.g., Staff HR contains Staff, Attendance, Shift Scheduling, Payroll, Performance)
- **Scrollable Sidebar**: Sidebar automatically scrolls when content exceeds available space
- **Logout**: Click the ⇱ button in the sidebar header to logout
- **Remember Me**: Check the "Remember me" checkbox to save credentials securely
- **Role-Based Access**: 28 predefined roles with granular permissions system
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `Ctrl+N`: Add new item
  - `Ctrl+S`: Save
  - `Ctrl+F`: Search
  - `Ctrl+E`: Edit
  - `Delete`: Delete selected
  - `F5`: Refresh
  - `Ctrl+T`: Toggle theme
  - `Ctrl+1` to `Ctrl+9`: Navigate to modules

## Development

### Adding New Modules

1. Create a new view class in `src/gui/`
2. Add navigation item to `src/gui/sidebar.py`
3. Add view method to `src/gui/erp_dashboard.py`
4. Connect navigation in `handle_navigation()`

### Database Changes

1. Update models in `src/database/models.py`
2. Delete old database file to recreate schema (or use migrations)
3. Re-run initialization scripts if needed

### Logging

Logs are stored in: `%APPDATA%\Sphincs ERP+POS\logs\`

The system uses `loguru` for comprehensive logging.

## Configuration

Configuration file location: `%APPDATA%\Sphincs ERP+POS\config.ini`

Example configuration:

```ini
[Database]
path = %APPDATA%\Sphincs ERP+POS\sphincs.db

[Updates]
enabled = true
check_on_startup = true
github_repo_owner = your-username
github_repo_name = your-repo-name

[UI]
theme = light
language = en
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
- Make sure you're in the project root directory
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip list`
- Check Python path is set correctly

### Database Errors
- Check that the config directory is writable
- Verify SQLite is working: `python -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"`
- Delete `sphincs.db` to recreate the database (data will be lost)

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure roles are created: `python src/utils/create_roles.py`
- Ensure admin user exists: `python src/utils/create_admin_staff.py`
- Check password hashing is working correctly

### GUI Not Showing
- Verify PyQt6 is installed: `python -c "from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication; print('OK')"`
- Check for error messages in the console
- Review logs in `%APPDATA%\Sphincs ERP+POS\logs\`
